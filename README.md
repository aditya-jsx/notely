## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need Node.js, npm, and Git installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aditys-jsx/notely.git
cd notely
```

### 2. Backend Setup
The backend server handles all API logic, database interactions, and authentication.

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create an environment file (`.env`) inside the `server` directory:

```env
# MongoDB
MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string

# JWT
JWT_USER_PASSWORD=your_super_secret_jwt_key

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Nodemailer (for OTP)
EMAIL_USER=your_gmail_address
EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password

# Frontend URL
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Run the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The backend will run on: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 3. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the client directory:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Create an environment file (`.env`) inside the `client` directory:

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
